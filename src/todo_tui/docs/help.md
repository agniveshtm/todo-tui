## Technical Details

- Built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io) : a Python TUI framework
- Data is persisted in a local **todo.db** database (`.todo-tui/todo.db`)
- Tasks are stored with creation and completion timestamps
- A success sound (`bell.wav`) plays when a task is marked complete (Windows only)
- Settings (such as the completion sound toggle) are persisted in a **SETTINGS** table inside `todo.db` and survive app restarts
